## Debate 2025-12-16 (ID: 1765863803)
**Verdict**: 85/100 (Needs Modification)
**Key Outcomes**:
1.  **Design Validated**: "Mode Separation Architecture" and general UI verified as fitting Power User models.
2.  **Logic Circuit Breaker Required**: Architecture must prevent hallucination cascades via hard logic stops (not just UI).
3.  **Memory Pollution Risk**: Risk of polluting long-term memory with debate artifacts. Stricter filtration required.
