## 1. Goal
Provide a visual interface for the **Virtual File System (VFS)**, allowing users to browse files generated by the `System Surgeon` and view version history.

### 2.2 Version History & Diff
- When a file is selected, show its version history (Agent authors, timestamps).
- Implementation: `GET /api/v1/sessions/:id/files/history?path=XXX`.
- **Monaco Diff Editor**:
  - Integrate `monaco-editor` (or similar) to show side-by-side diffs.
  - Left: Previous Version.
  - Right: Current Version.

## 3. UI Design
- **Location**: A new tab "Codebase" in the `MeetingRoom` right panel (alongside "Knowledge").
- **Layout**:
  - Top/Left: File Tree.
  - Center/Right: Diff/Code View.
